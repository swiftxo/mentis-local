**📜 Etymology of _Archivum_**

> The English word _archive_ is derived from the French _archives_ (plural), and in turn from Latin _archīum_ or _archīvum_, the romanized form of the Greek ἀρχεῖον (_arkheion_). The Greek term originally referred to the home or dwelling of the _[Archon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archon)_,  a ruler or chief magistrate, in which important official state documents were filed and interpreted; from there its meaning broadened to encompass such concepts as "_[town hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_hall "Town hall")_" and "_[public records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_records "Public records")_". The root of the Greek word is ἀρχή (_arkhē_), meaning among other things “magistracy, office, government,” and derived from the verb ἄρχω (_arkhō_), meaning “to begin, rule, govern” (also the root of English words such as _anarchy_ and _monarchy_).

I first chose the word Archivum because I like latin terminology, however upon further digging and investigating the origin of this word, I was pleasantly surprised. This isn't just dry etymology. The history of this word covers the concepts of knowledge, law and power. It is poetic in context of this paper and concept that I am exploring right now. Archivum does not only refer to a simple storage of knowledge. It means having control, governing your mind and thoughts.
